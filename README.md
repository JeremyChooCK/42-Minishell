# Minishell

This project is about creating a simple shell.

## Notes

This repo will add some additional stuff such as pdf and tester for convenience sake, remember to remove it when copying the code to vogsphere.

To test the code, run make on root directory, afterwards cd to minishell_tester and run the tester script. that tester is coded for macos environment, hence linux will fail all test cases.

## Tester

https://github.com/cacharle/minishell_test

pip3 install minishell-test

python3 -m minishell_test
